## 📝 About VolleyRotationsApp

VolleyRotationsApp is a free and interactive web application developed with R Studio and Shiny. It helps volleyball coaches visualize and plan team rotations with ease. With this app, you can create formations for two teams and see how they match up across all six rotations. It offers the following features:

- **➕ Add/Modify Players Button:** Easily update court diagrams after entering player information. You can assign a number (1-99) and a name (recommended max: 10 characters, including spaces) for proper display. Team A is shown in blue, Team B in red for clear distinction.

- **❌ Delete Players Button:** Instantly remove all player data and reset the court diagrams to a blank state.

- **🔄 Rotation Buttons:** Adjust team rotations using the 'Rotate +1 position (clockwise)' and 'Rotate -1 position (counterclockwise)' buttons. To rotate multiple positions at once, use the 'Multiple rotation options' button.

- **📊 Rotations View:** Displays all six possible rotations simultaneously for both teams, allowing you to analyze player matchups. The diagrams illustrate each team's basic positions at the start of a point, before any positional adjustments or switches following the referee’s whistle.

## 💡 Future features and ideas for VolleyRotationsApp

In future versions of VolleyRotationsApp, we are considering adding the following features:

- **📑 Predefined groups tab**: A new tab to create non-random or manually assigned training or competition groups.
- **🔢 Sampling tab**: A new tab to create samples or subgroups of players from the existing player pool.
- **📊 Sociogram tab**: A new tab to visualize which players have trained or competed together most frequently.
- **🏆 Match outcome recording function**: A new function to record both the winning and losing teams or groups after a real or training match.
