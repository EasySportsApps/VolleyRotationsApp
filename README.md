VolleyRotationsApp is a free and interactive web application developed with RStudio and Shiny. It helps volleyball coaches visualize and plan team rotations with ease. With this app, you can create formations for two teams and see how they match up across all six rotations. Key features include:

- **<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/000000/add-user-male.png"/> Add/Modify Players Button:** Easily update court diagrams after entering player information. You can assign a number (1-99) and a name (recommended max: 10 characters, including spaces) for proper display. Team A is shown in blue, Team B in red for clear distinction.

- **<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/000000/delete.png"/> Delete Players Button:** Instantly remove all player data and reset the court diagrams to a blank state.

- **<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/000000/refresh.png"/> Rotation Buttons:** Adjust team rotations using the 'Rotate +1 position (clockwise)' and 'Rotate -1 position (counterclockwise)' buttons. To rotate multiple positions at once, use the 'Multiple rotation options' button.

- **<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/000000/volleyball-player.png"/> Rotations View:** Displays all six possible rotations simultaneously for both teams, allowing you to analyze player matchups. The diagrams illustrate each team's basic positions at the start of a point, before any positional adjustments or switches following the referee’s whistle.

In future versions, we are considering adding the following features:

- **<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/000000/print.png"/> Print Button:** Add a button in the Rotations View to easily print each team's rotations and matchups.  

- **<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/000000/refresh.png"/> Enhanced Rotations View:** Improve the Rotations View by displaying player positions in reception (Complex I) or defense (Complex II), considering the team that started the serve in the set. This will provide a more realistic and detailed view of player positioning and interactions on the court.  

If you have any suggestions for improvement, feel free to share them in the [Discussions](https://github.com/EasySportsApps/VolleyRotationsApp/discussions) section of our GitHub repository or send us an [email](mailto:easysportsappsproject@gmail.com).
